## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced) . The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 2. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.


## 15 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
   ```sql
  	SELECT * FROM spotify
	WHERE stream>1000000000;
   ```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
    ```sql
  	SELECT DISTINCT(album),artist
	FROM spotify;
   ```
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
   ```sql
  	SELECT SUM(comments) as total_comments
	FROM spotify
	WHERE licensed='True';
   ```
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
  ```sql
  	SELECT *
	FROM spotify
	WHERE album_type='single';
   ```
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
    ```sql
  	SELECT artist,COUNT(*) AS total_songs
	FROM spotify
	GROUP BY artist
	ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC;
   ```
 

### Medium Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
    ```sql
  	SELECT album,AVG(danceability) as Avg_danceability
	FROM spotify
	GROUP BY album
	ORDER BY AVG(danceability);
   ```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
    ```sql
  	SELECT track,MAX(energy)
	FROM spotify
	GROUP BY track 
	ORDER BY MAX(energy) DESC
	LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
    ```sql
  	SELECT track,SUM(views) as total_views,SUM(likes) as total_likes
	FROM spotify
	WHERE official_video='True'
	GROUP BY track;
   ```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
    ```sql
  	SELECT album,track,SUM(views)
	FROM spotify
	GROUP BY album,track
	ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC;
   ```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
     ```sql
  	SELECT * FROM (SELECT 
 	track,
	coalesce(SUM(CASE WHEN most_playedon='Youtube' THEN stream END),0) AS streamed_on_youtube,
	coalesce(SUM(CASE WHEN most_playedon='Spotify' THEN stream END),0) AS streamed_on_spotify
	FROM spotify
	GROUP BY track) as t1
	WHERE 
		streamed_on_spotify>streamed_on_youtube
    	AND
    	streamed_on_youtube <> 0;
   ```

### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
   ```sql
  	WITH ranking_artist AS
	(
    	SELECT
        	artist,
        	track,
        	SUM(views) AS total_view,
        	DENSE_RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY artist
            	ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC
        	) AS track_rank
    FROM spotify
    GROUP BY artist, track
	)
	SELECT *
	FROM ranking_artist
	WHERE track_rank <= 3;
   ```
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
   ```sql
  	SELECT * FROM spotify 
	WHERE 
	liveness>(SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);
   ```
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
4. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
5. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
